# `nix develop` Examples

In this repository, I collect `flake.nix` files which demonstrate various `nix develop` features.

# How to run the examples

Every example_* folder contains a `flake.nix`.
Navigate into one of the folders and run `nix develop`.

# Examples

## example_001

* Set the environment variable `FOO`.
* Create the script `foo.sh` which prints the value of the variable `FOO`. It can be run as `foo.sh`.
